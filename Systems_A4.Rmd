# list of BigWig files from ATAC-seq experiment
# the experiment compares 2 clones (Clone3 and Clone16) w/ and w/o IAA treatment
# IAA treatment depletes CTCF protein through the auxin-inducible degron system

Questions: 

1) What are the core components of a GRanges object? List them.

GRanges is a vector of genomic locations and associate annotations. Each element
in the vector consists of a sequence name, an interval, and a strand.

2) Compare the number of ranges between Clone16_Untreated and Clone16_IAA.

Clone16_Untreated has 1828285 ranges, and Clone16_IAA has 1549060 ranges. This
indicates that IAA treatment results in fewer regions of open chormatin being
detected.


```{r}
# Extracting Clone16 Untreated data for analysis
gr1 <- gr_list[["Clone16_Untreated"]]

# Demonstrating basic range operations
# 1. Subset ranges on specific chromosomes
chr1_ranges <- gr1[seqnames(gr1) == "chr1"]

# 2. Find ranges within a specific genomic window
region_of_interest <- GRanges("chr1", IRanges(1, 1000000)) # First 1Mb of chr1
window_peaks <- subsetByOverlaps(gr1, region_of_interest)

# 3. Calculate coverage
peak_coverage <- coverage(gr1)

# Calculate basic statistics
chr1_stats <- data.frame(
mean_score = mean(chr1_ranges$score),
median_score = median(chr1_ranges$score),
n_peaks = length(chr1_ranges)
)
```

Questions (un-comment and fill in the code):
```{r}
# 1) Find all ranges on chromosome 2:
chr2_ranges <- gr1[seqnames(gr1) == 'chr2']

# 2) Calculate the median score:
median_score <- median(chr2_ranges$score)
```

Part 3: Promoter Analysis
```{r}
# Load gene model database for human genome (hg19)
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene

# Extract all gene coordinates
genes <- genes(txdb)
```
```{r}
# Define promoter regions (Â±2kb around transcription start sites)
# The promoters() function automatically handles strand information
promoter_regions <- promoters(genes, upstream = 2000, downstream = 2000)
seqlevelsStyle(promoter_regions) <- seqlevelsStyle(gr_list[[1]])
promoter_regions
```
```{r}
# Demonstrate range arithmetic
# reduce() merges overlapping ranges
promoter_reduced <- reduce(promoter_regions)

# disjoin() creates non-overlapping ranges
promoter_disjoin <- disjoin(promoter_regions)

# Find closest genes to peaks
nearest_genes <- nearest(gr_list[[1]], promoter_regions)
```

Questions:

1) Why do we use promoters() instead of just adding/subtracting from gene start
   positions?

The promoters() function automatically accounts for the strand information
of each gene. Simply adding or subtracting a fixed number from the gene start
positions would ignore that genes on the negative strand have their 
transcription start sites oriented in the opposite direction.

2) What does the seqlevelsStyle() function do and why is it necessary?

The seqlevelsStyle() function allows us to get/set the naming convention for the
sequence levels (chromosome names) in the GRanges objects. This is necessary 
because different genomic resources may use different naming conventions.

Part 4: Gene Annotation & Overlap Analysis
```{r}
# Load human gene annotation database
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
```
```{r}
# Extract Entrez gene IDs and map to gene symbols
entrez_ids <- as.character(promoter_regions$gene_id)
gene_symbols <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                       keys = entrez_ids,
                       column = 'SYMBOL',       # get gene symbols
                       keytype = 'ENTREZID',    # input ID type
                       multiVals = 'first')     # take first mapping if multiple exist
```
```{r}
# Add gene symbols to promoter regions
promoter_regions$gene_symbol <- gene_symbols

# Find overlaps between ATAC-seq peaks and promoter regions
overlap_results <- lapply(gr_list, function(gr) {
  overlaps <- findOverlaps(gr, promoter_regions)
  gr[queryHits(overlaps)]
})

# Calculate overlap statistics
overlap_stats <- lapply(overlap_results, function(gr) {
  data.frame(
    n_peaks = length(gr),
    mean_score = mean(gr$score),
    median_score = median(gr$score)
  )
})

overlap_stats
```

Questions:

1) What does findOverlaps() return?

The findOverlaps() function compares 2 GRanges objects and returns indices of 
intervals that overlap between them. It's used to determine which peaks from 
gr1 fall within defined genomic regions.

2) Uncomment and fill in the blanks in the code below to find only overlaps on
   chromosome 1:
```{r}
chr1_overlaps <- findOverlaps(
  gr_list[[1]][seqnames(gr_list[[1]]) == 'chr1'],
  gr_list[[2]][seqnames(gr_list[[2]]) == 'chr1']
)
```

                      (promoter_matrix[, 'Clone3_Untreated'] + 1))

```


Questions - Looking at the heatmap and scatter plot:

1) What patterns do you observe in the differential accessibility between 
   IAA and untreated conditions?

The heatmap shows that many genes in both Clone3 and Clone16 become more 
accessible when treated with IAA, but this is more prevalent with Clone16. The 
scatter plot shows that most promoters cluster around (0, 0), indicating no 
large difference bwtween IAA and untreated in either clone. However, there are 
some promoters far from the origin in the upper-right quadrant, which is 
consistent with the heatmap showig strong increases in accessibility for certain
promoters upon IAA treatment.

2) Why might we use both a heatmap and a scatter plot to visualize this data?

While the scatterplot makes it easier to assess overall trends and to identify 
outliers, the heatmap allows us to see clusters or patterns that might group 
promoters with similar behavior. Together, these two visualizations offer both a
broad overview and a more focused comparison of differential changes between 
conditions.

Part 6: Trying It Yourself
```{r}
ctcf_promoter <- promoter_regions[!is.na(promoter_regions$gene_symbol) 
                                  & promoter_regions$gene_symbol == 'CTCF']
ctcf_window <- resize(ctcf_promoter, width(ctcf_promoter) + 10000, fix='center')
nearby_peaks <- gr1[queryHits(findOverlaps(gr1, ctcf_window))]

# count the number of peaks within the extended CTCF promoter windows
num_ctcf_peaks <- length(nearby_peaks)
print(num_ctcf_peaks)
```

1) How many peaks fall within 5kb of CTCF promoters?

Running the code above produced 244 peaks that fall within 5kb of CTCF 
promoters.
